* emacs-packages-mirrors

Git mirror of the emacs source archives

** Usage

For now, since I'm not sure how to effectively upload files many files nor do I want to get in trouble for doing
so, simply close the repository and run the rsync script yourself for package mirrors.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
./rsync.sh
#+END_SRC

Then source the folders as a valid archives in your emacs configuration.
