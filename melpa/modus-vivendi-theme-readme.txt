This theme is designed for colour-contrast accessibility.

1. Provide a consistent minimum contrast ratio between background and
foreground values of 7:1 or higher.  This meets the highest such
accessibility criterion per the guidelines of the Worldwide Web
Consortium's Working Group on Accessibility (WCAG AAA standard).

2. Offer as close to full face coverage as possible.  The list is
already quite long (see further below), with more additions to follow
as part of the ongoing development process.

The theme provides the following customisation options, all of which
are disabled by default:

    modus-vivendi-theme-slanted-constructs
    modus-vivendi-theme-bold-constructs
    modus-vivendi-theme-proportional-fonts
    modus-vivendi-theme-scale-headings

The default scale is as follows (it can be customised as well):

    modus-vivendi-theme-scale-1 1.05
    modus-vivendi-theme-scale-2 1.1
    modus-vivendi-theme-scale-3 1.15
    modus-vivendi-theme-scale-4 1.2

What follows is the list of explicitly supported packages or face
groups (there are implicitly supported packages as well, which
inherit from font-lock or some basic group).  You are encouraged to
notify me of any missing package or change you would like to see.
