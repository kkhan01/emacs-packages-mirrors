This is a color theme generator for Emacs with an eye towards Spacemacs
<https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs>, and `spacemacs-theme'
<https://github.com/nashamri/spacemacs-theme>, but no dependencies on either,
so you can use it to colorize your vanilla Emacs as well.

My hope is that `ewal' will remain theme agnostic, with people contributing
functions like `ewal-get-spacemacs-theme-colors' for other popular themes
such as `solarized-emacs' <https://github.com/bbatsov/solarized-emacs>,
making it easy to keep the style of different themes, while adapting them to
the rest of your theming setup. No problem should ever have to be solved
twice!
