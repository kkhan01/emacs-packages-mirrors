;;; Commentary:

;; Evaluate expressions in a separate Emacs process:
;;
;; ```elisp
;; (with-emacs :path "/path/to/version/emacs" :lexical t
;;   (do-something)
;;   ...)
;; ```

;; See README for more information.

;;; Change Log:


;; 0.2.1  2019/08/19
;;
;;   Refactor the macro with-emacs
;;
;; 0.2.0  2019/06/05
;;
;;   Add function -extract-return-value to replace the regexp to get more
;;   accurate result and remove the outer double quotes from return value.
;;
;; 0.1.0  2019/04/20
;;
;;   Initial version.
